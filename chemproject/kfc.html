              <p>SD (lysergic acid diethylamide) is a hallucinogen, meaning that it can alter a person’s perception of reality and vividly distort the senses. The drug is normally produced as tartrate salt, which is colourless, odourless and water soluble. <br><br>

The hallucinogenic effect of LSD was first discovered in 1943 by Dr. Albert Hofmann, a chemical researcher at a pharmaceutical company. His original studies were exploring potential use of the drug to treat certain kinds of mental illness, and to observe their effect on those who suffered from these illnesses, though later in the 1950s, there were experiments regarding the drug for its ability to affect the brain, taking the user into a state of “cosmic consciousness.”<br><br>

We know that external influences can change the effect that LSD has on users: their mindset, and their environment. Their expectations, or mood at the time they take the drug can have an effect on how the drug affects them. The setting, or place where they are also has an influence, so for those who use the drug, the possibility of an adverse reaction may be reduced by taking the drug only when already in a positive state of mind, in a relaxed environment and with supportive friends. <br><br>

LSD usage can result in long-term effects no matter how many times one uses the drug. Possible effects include “flashbacks” of the drug experience, anxiety, depression or psychosis. These reactions usually decrease over time, but may continue for years.

<h2>Chemical composition</h2>

<p>The LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide) belongs to a family of indole alkylamines that includes tryptamines such as psilocin (found in ‘magic’ mushrooms)
The active ingredient of Lysergic acid is illegal due its high potential for abuse, and its dangerous impact on the brain. Its chemical formula is C16H16N2O2.
</p><br>
<h2>How is it created ? </h2>
<p>There are three main ways that LSD is produced using lysergic acid. The first common tactic is treatment of the acid with lithium hydroxide, which then forms lithium lysergate. This is then reacted with a  sulfur-trioxide dimethylformamide complex and diethylamine to form the final product.<br><br>

The second method uses a reaction between lysergic acid with N,N-carbonyldiimidazole, then a treatment with diethylamine.<br><br>

The third method is an ergot alkaloid is treated with hydrazine hydrate to form lysergic acid hydrazide. Then, using sodium nitrate, the hydrazide is converted to the azide which is then reacted with diethylamine.<br><br>
 
After all these methods are used, the product is usually a crude product which contains by-products. The crude substance is usually then chromatographed on an alumina column, or by a series of partitions between weak organic acids and weak bases with a suitable organic solvent (such as tartaric acid or sodium bicarbonate).
