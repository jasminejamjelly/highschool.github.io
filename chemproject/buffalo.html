              <p>These chemical substances, although their harm our minds, have a fascinating relationship with the human brain. Nevertheless, these substances have been outlawed for good reason; hundreds of thousands have fallen victim to overdose, and drug abuse accounts for about 9% of the reasons for homelessness. Although their temporary effects on mental state may be appealing, there are detrimental effects both physically and psychologically in the long run. Additionally, the effects of illegal drugs can be unpredictable since people respond differently to the same drugs, there is no quality control for production of these substances. Thus, we must stress the importance of regulation of usage and distribution, as well as providing accessible support to those who suffer from the effects of these substances.
